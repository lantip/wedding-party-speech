In the `repository` of lives, these two `branches` are now `merged`.

Sometimes there will be `conflicts,` but don't panic, read the `source` and find a way to solve them.

The husband shall not run `git blame`.

And when the wife sends `pull requests`, `merge` them quickly.

If there's ever any problems, don't hesitate to open an `issue`, be open and deal with them; it is the most important aspect of all in this long story of life.

In terms of the design of life, it would be good to set up `milestones`. "Do this at this time, be this when we reach certain age." Having `milestones` enriches people and keeps people moving forward.

When looking at other couples, if ever thinking "Ahh.. would be nice to be like them," please `cherry-pick` quickly and `aggressively`.
